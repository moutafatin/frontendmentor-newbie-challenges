## My process

### Built with

- Half Semantic HTML5 markup (Just started with frontend)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to style the marker of lists using `::marker` pseudo element

```css
li::marker {
  color: purple;
}
```

## Future Improvements

I'm currently going through The Odin Project, and I plan to revisit this project as I learn more. Here are a few areas I want to improve:

- Make better use of semantic HTML
- Make the website responsive for large screens (currently only mobile)
- Refactor and organize
